# Add chat interface

- Have buffer in chat input, so i can do arrow up to go to my previous inputs
- Use tools instead of prompt to force json output from LLM.

# Data lineage

- add data lineage (from file, maybe add intermediate steps, then to the output)
- when chatting with the LLM, make sure it also output the data lineage if it says something about an entity. This enhances trust.

# Loader

- Use tools instead of prompt to force json output from LLM.
- Load inside the GUI. Show progress, scroll discovered entities and relations.
