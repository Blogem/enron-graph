# Add chat interface

- Add chat interface to ask about entities/the graph.
- See if the graph can update if a certain entity is discussed (or better: make the entity in the chat output clickable)

# Data lineage

- add data lineage (from file, maybe add intermediate steps, then to the output)
- when chatting with the LLM, make sure it also output the data lineage if it says something about an entity

# Promotor

- Adjust logic inside extractor to handle promoted types (a mapping of those can be generated by ent)
- Move analysis + promoter logic to the GUI, so it can be demoed

# Loader

- Use tools instead of prompt to force json output.
