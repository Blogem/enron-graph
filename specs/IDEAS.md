# Add chat interface

- Have buffer in chat input, so i can do arrow up to go to my previous inputs
- Use tools instead of prompt to force json output from LLM.

# Data lineage

- add data lineage (from file, maybe add intermediate steps, then to the output)
- when chatting with the LLM, make sure it also output the data lineage if it says something about an entity. This enhances trust.

# Analyst/promotor

- Adjust logic inside extractor to handle promoted types (FYI: a mapping of those can be generated by ent using a template)
-- there is a TODO in extractor for dealing with fetching the data. Basically we need to find a way to both look for a promoted type as well as a discovered type. We need to make this as performant as possible. Use the openspec explore agent to find a good solution for this that fits with the current implementation.
- Move analysis + promoter logic to the GUI, so it can be demoed

# Loader

- Use tools instead of prompt to force json output from LLM.
- Load inside the GUI. Show progress, scroll discovered entities and relations.
