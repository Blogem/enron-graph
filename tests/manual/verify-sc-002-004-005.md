# Manual Verification Tests for Success Criteria SC-002, SC-004, SC-005

These success criteria require manual verification through the Graph Explorer UI.

## SC-002: Navigate 100-500 Nodes Smoothly

**Requirement**: Users can successfully navigate and explore a graph subset of 100-500 nodes with smooth pan/zoom interactions (no lag or stuttering)

### Test Steps:
1. Start the Graph Explorer: `cd cmd/explorer && wails dev`
2. Wait for the app to load 100 initial nodes
3. Perform the following interactions and verify smooth performance:
   - Pan the graph in all directions (drag with mouse)
   - Zoom in and out (mouse wheel or pinch)
   - Click and drag nodes to reposition them
   - Click on the "Load Random Nodes" if needed to load more

### Pass Criteria:
- [ ] All pan operations are smooth with no stuttering
- [ ] Zoom operations respond immediately (<100ms perceived delay)
- [ ] Graph rendering remains at 30+ FPS during interactions
- [ ] No lag when clicking/dragging nodes

### Result:
- **Status**: ___________
- **Performance Notes**: ___________
- **Tested with N nodes**: ___________

## SC-004: Filters Update in <1 Second

**Requirement**: Users can successfully filter the graph to show only specific entity types and see results update within 1 second

### Test Steps:
1. Start the Graph Explorer with loaded nodes
2. Open the filter bar (if collapsed)
3. Use the search box to filter by entity type (e.g., type "person")
4. Time how long it takes for the graph to update
5. Click on type filter buttons ("All", "Promoted Only", "Discovered Only")
6. Time how long it takes for each filter change

### Pass Criteria:
- [ ] Search filter updates graph in <1 second
- [ ] Type filter buttons update graph in <1 second
- [ ] Filtered results are visually correct
- [ ] Filter count/indicators update correctly

### Result:
- **Search Filter Time**: ___________
- **Type Filter Time**: ___________
- **Status**: ___________

## SC-005: Promoted vs Discovered Visually Distinct

**Requirement**: The interface clearly distinguishes between promoted schema types and discovered entities (visible through separate sections or visual indicators)

### Test Steps:
1. Start the Graph Explorer
2. Examine the Schema Panel on the left
3. Look at nodes in the graph canvas
4. Verify visual distinction between promoted and discovered types

### Visual Checks:
- [ ] Schema Panel has separate "Promoted Types" section with ⭐ icon
- [ ] Schema Panel has separate "Discovered Types" section with 🔍 icon
- [ ] Promoted type items have distinct styling (e.g., different background)
- [ ] Discovered type items have distinct styling
- [ ] Graph nodes for promoted types have different colors/badges
- [ ] Graph nodes for discovered types have different colors/badges
- [ ] Visual distinction is immediately obvious without reading labels

### Pass Criteria:
- [ ] Promoted and discovered types are in separate sections
- [ ] Visual styling clearly differentiates the two categories
- [ ] First-time users can distinguish them within 5 seconds

### Result:
- **Status**: ___________
- **Visual Clarity (1-10)**: ___________
- **Notes**: ___________

## SC-007: Exploration Task in <5 Minutes (First Use)

**Requirement**: Users can complete a typical exploration task (view schema → load graph subset → filter by type → examine node details) in under 5 minutes on first use

### Test Steps (Timed):
1. **Start Timer** - Launch Graph Explorer for the first time
2. **View Schema** - Examine the schema panel and understand promoted/discovered types
3. **Load Graph** - Wait for initial graph to load
4. **Filter by Type** - Use filters to show only one entity type (e.g., "person")
5. **Examine Node** - Click on a node and view its details in the detail panel
6. **Stop Timer**

### Pass Criteria:
- [ ] Complete workflow in <5 minutes
- [ ] All steps are intuitive (no help documentation needed)
- [ ] No errors or confusion during the workflow

### Result:
- **Total Time**: ___________
- **Status**: ___________
- **User Confusion Points**: ___________

## How to Run These Tests

```bash
# Terminal 1: Start the Graph Explorer
cd /Users/jochem/code/enron-graph-2/cmd/explorer
wails dev

# Terminal 2: Ensure database has sufficient test data
cd /Users/jochem/code/enron-graph-2
go run cmd/loader/main.go  # If needed to load more data
```

## Recording Results

After completing all tests, update this file with results and create a summary:

```bash
# Create results file
cp tests/manual/verify-sc-002-004-005.md tests/manual/verify-sc-002-004-005-results.md
# Edit with your test results
# Then commit
git add tests/manual/verify-sc-002-004-005-results.md
git commit -m "test: manual verification results for SC-002, SC-004, SC-005, SC-007"
```
